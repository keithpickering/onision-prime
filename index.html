      <h2>Frequently asked questions*</h2>
      
      <ul class="faqs">
        <li>
          <h3>How can I join the Onision harem?</h3>
          <p>The Onision harem is always accepting new members, the only requirements are that you have to be under 70 pounds and come from a troubled family background. Onision is baseically
            like Jared the subway guy except he hasn't been arrested yet.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Dude, did you really poop on your back?</h3>
          <p>LOL no, Onision only <em>pretended</em> to poop on his back. That's WAY different and cooler.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>You realize pretending to be an idiot doesn't accomplish anything but make you look like an idiot though, right?</h3>
          <p>Onision doesn't expect peons such as yourself to understand the subtleties of his actions.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Where did Onision grow up?</h3>
          <p>Ha, trick question!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>What is Onision's age?</h3>
          <p>Onision is only <span id="age">34</span> years old (and not a day older), but mentally he's perpetually 17.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Did Onision seriously change his name to the name of the Mary Sue protagonist from his children's book?</h3>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Wow.</h3>
          <p>Yeah, the psychoanalysts must have a field day with this one.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Is Onision dead?</h3>
          <p>Only on the inside, and the pelvic area whenever the pile of garbage in my house gets so deep that I can't find my cock pump.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>After Onision gets too visibly old to bring in young girls to groom and leech talent from, what will he do for a living?</h3>
          <p>...</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Is Onision a dad?</h3>
          <p>Oh shit, you're right! I better check the second-story window, brb!</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

        *Nobody has ever actually asked me any of these questions, or any other question about my life, 
        other than "holy shit, isn't that Onision, the world-renowned sex trafficker extraordinaire?"
        Also, by reading this sentence you agree to be chained in my basement for an indeterminate amount of time.
